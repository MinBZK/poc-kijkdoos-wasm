## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Code of Conduct](https://minbzk.github.io/ai-validation/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to **[ai-validatie@minbzk.nl](mailto:ai-validatie@minbzk.nl)**.

## I Have a Question

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/MinBZK/ai-validation/issues)
that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question
in this issue.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/MinBZK/ai-validation/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to
investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the
following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there
is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/MinBZK/ai-validation/issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Collect information about the bug
- Possibly your input and the output

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue
tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to **[ai-validatie@minbzk.nl](mailto:ai-validatie@minbzk.nl)**.

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/MinBZK/ai-validation/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it
is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to
recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no
obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with
the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as
`critical`), and the issue will be left to be implemented by someone.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for this project, **including completely new
features and minor improvements**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the
community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/MinBZK/ai-validation/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been
suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to
convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful
to the majority of our users and not just a small subset.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/MinBZK/ai-validation/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point
you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part
which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on MacOS and
 Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** for the community. You may also want to point out the
other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.
